1. Implement the interface TableModelService:
{{{
public interface TableModelService extends RemoteService {
	public TableColumn[] getColumns();
	public int getRowsCount(DataFilter[] filters);
	public String[][] getRows(int startRow, int rowsCount,
		DataFilter[] filters, String sortColumn, boolean sortOrder);
}
}}}

2. Create AdvancedTable widget, assign table model and add it to the root panel:
